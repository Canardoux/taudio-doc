# Flutter Sound API Ref.

Flutter Sound is composed with three main classes:

- [FlutterSoundPlayer](/api/public_fs_flutter_sound_player/FlutterSoundPlayer-class.html) allows you to create entities able to play something
- [FlutterSoundRecorder](/api/public_fs_flutter_sound_recorder/FlutterSoundRecorder-class.html) allows you to create entities able to record something
- [FlutterSoundHelper](/api/public_fs_flutter_sound_helper/FlutterSoundHelper-class.html) is a singleton which offers some utility functions.
