## The τ family

The `Tau` family begins to be rich :). It is composed by those following Flutter plugins.

- `Flutter Sound 9.x` (this legacy plugin developed for many years)
- [Etau](/tau/family/etau.html) (which is a port on Flutter Web of the W3C Web Audio API)
- [Tauweb](/tau/family/tauweb.html) (which is the `Etau` implementation for Flutter Web)
- [Tauwar](/tau/family/tauwar.html) (which is the `Etau` implementation for Flutter on mobiles)
- [Taudio](/tau/family/taudio.html) (which is (will be) something like Flutter Sound 10.0)
